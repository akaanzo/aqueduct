# Aqueduct network project in Pergine Valsugana (TN)

This repository is composed by  :

*  GIS file containing georeferenced Pergine's map and some other shape files;
*  INP files containing network's plan (need QEPANET and QGIS);
*  NET files for the network analysis (need EPANET);
*  a TEX beamer file to presenting the job we've done.

The aqueduct network has been created with *QEPANET* plugin for QGIS, developed by University of Trento and Free University of Bolzano.  
QEPANET is a python-based plugin, that works with QGIS version 2.18.14 only, allowing to create easily an EPANET in QGIS. For more info, visit QEPANET GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/aecforge/QEPANET).  

For the analysis process we used EPANET software, developed by EPA (Environmental Protection Agency).
